This is a pass for the LLVM compiler which allows to visualize the Basic
Blocks. Visualization is done with the GraphViz tool. The DAG is builded with
the help of a boost library.

This feature is not available with LLVM compiler.
LLVM allows to list the control-flow-graphs with the source codes.

Example can be found in lib/test/entry.pdf directory.
