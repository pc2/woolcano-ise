We are building here static libraries which then are dynamically linked.
In order to do that we need to create the "Position-independent code":

export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -fPIC"
export CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -fPIC"


We also have to disable the "-undefine dynamic_lookup" flag for linker.
It can't be used on Linux systems - only on Darwin systems

The ISE methods are working in 32 bit mode.
This is because ISE methods were compiled with ise_frozen branch (27 may 2009)
of llvm, which is still release 2.5.
In order to get it working one needs 2.5 llvm-gcc front-end release which is
available in binaries only in 32 bit mode. I couldn't compile the front end
sucsesfully on clovertown (centos) machine without root access (there is a
need for many libraries). It always ended up with different errors. Therefor
the only way was to use the 32 bit mode.

The 2.6 front-end (which comes in 32 and 64bit mode) from binaries is not compatible with the ISE pass. 

In order to make the pass running one needs to:
export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -m32"
export CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -m32"
- install llvm-gcc front end binaries for the 2.5 release
- compile llvm ise_frozen branch in 32 bit mode
- compile ISE pass
