We are building here static libraries which then are dynamically linked.
In order to do that we need to create the "Position-independent code":

export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -fPIC"
export CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -fPIC"


We also have to disable the "-undefine dynamic_lookup" flag for linker.
It can't be used on Linux systems - only on Darwin systems
