In order to work under XCode IDE issue the following command to create the
XCode project:

cd woolcano-ise && mkdir Xcode && cd Xcode
cmake -G"Xcode" ..
open woolcano-ise.xcodeproj

Remember that whenver you will add new file (source or header) it will work
under the Xcode but you have to manually change the CMakeFiles.txt to enable
it during the build process outside the Xcode.
