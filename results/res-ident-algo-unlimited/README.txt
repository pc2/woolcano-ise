Results for the identification algorithm.
- all results without candidate.insert() methods (no operation on data)
- benchmarks with tick set to 100 (-bench-ticks 100)

Results data are stored in these directories:
  i2-o1/
  i2-o2/
  i4-o1/
  i4-o2/
  i8-o1/
  i8-o2/

Important thing to remember is that the maxmiso algorithm can't be
constrained. It is always multiple input single output (miso).
This is why the results for maxmiso in each directory will be similiar.
